Overview
--------

SpaceWire Light is a SpaceWire encoder-decoder with FIFO interface.
It is synthesizable for FPGA targets (up to 200 Mbit on Spartan-3).

The goal is to provide a complete, reliable, fast implementation
of a SpaceWire encoder-decoder according to ECSS-E-50-12C.
The core is "light" in the sense that it does not provide additional
features such as RMAP, routing etc.

See doc/Manual.pdf for more information.

Future plans:
 * add AMBA bus interface
 * try to run on Virtex
